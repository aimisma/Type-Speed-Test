This game allows you to test how fast you can type in 60 seconds. In the allotted time, you try to type the words the game randomly shows. Only correct words (those that match the spelling) count for your score.


HELP!!!
The game should show you in red when you write a character in a word wrong. For example, if the given word is "cat" and you write "cst" the game should mark the "s" in red. Right now, when I run it, this only happens on the first word, not on the consecutive ones. I've spent about a week trying to figure this out, but I simply can't.

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
